C Made Easy (CME) is a simple C library that provide "pure-c" solutions for high-level code.

CME will provide (for now) 3 big things :
- Lists (simple linked lists, with functions associated)
- Dicts (simple dictionaries, containing key-value paires)
- Args (same as `va_args`, to make functions that take any number of parameters)
